704)) binary search

LOGIC::

Since the array is sorted,

we don’t need to check every element one by one.

We can:

• Take two pointers → start and end
• Find the middle element

Now compare middle element with target:

• If middle equals target → return its index
• If target is smaller than middle → search left half
• If target is greater than middle → search right half

We keep repeating this process
until start becomes greater than end.

If we don’t find the target → return -1.

code::

public class Solution {
    
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;          // target found
            } 
            else if (target < nums[mid]) {
                end = mid - 1;       // search left half
            } 
            else {
                start = mid + 1;     // search right half
            }
        }
        
        return -1;   // target not found
    }
}
