162. Find Peak Element

LOGIC::

In this problem, we need to find a peak element. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighboring elements.

Instead of checking every element one by one, we use Binary Search to make it faster.

We take two pointers: start and end.

Then we find the middle element.

We compare the middle element with its next element.

If the middle element is greater than the next element, it means we are on a decreasing slope. So the peak must be on the left side, including the middle element.

If the middle element is smaller than the next element, it means we are on an increasing slope. So the peak must be on the right side.

We keep repeating this process until start and end become equal.

At that point, that index is a peak element.

CODE::

public class Solution {
    
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                end = mid;          // peak is on left side (including mid)
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;    // peak is on right side
            }
        }
        
        return start;   // or return end (both are same)
    }
}
